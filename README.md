# IoT Playground

A mono-repo for IoT projects developed using different platforms and IDEs, including **Nano RP2040** and **ESP32**. This repository serves as a space for experimenting with IoT devices and contains assignments, examples, and reusable components.

## Platforms

- **Nano RP2040**: Projects based on the Raspberry Pi Nano RP2040.
- **Freenove ESP32**: Projects for the Freenove ESP32 board.

## IDEs and Tools

- **PlatformIO**: For advanced, cross-platform development with support for both RP2040 and ESP32.
- **Arduino IDE**: For simpler development and prototyping.

## How to Use

1. **PlatformIO Projects**: Navigate to the `platformio_projects/` folder and choose your platform and project.
2. **Arduino Projects**: Navigate to the `arduino_projects/` folder to explore projects using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Shared Libraries**: You can find reusable code and libraries in the `shared_libraries/` folder.

## Future Plans

- Add more projects based on different IoT devices and sensors.
- Expand examples to include cloud integration, data processing, and IoT security.
